# Recipe-Finder-Project

Iteration 1: 
  - the searching function is available in the navbar, through entering searching keyword, it will lead to a new page with recipe matches the searching keyword


Iteration 2: {url} is in format of 'http://localhost:5173'
  - filter function: located on the "{url}/", "filer by tag". Apply filter to the recipe, currently, there's only dog and cat tag. Note: it requires the user to click on the tag twice to display the correct recipes. (need to fix)
  - Add new recipe: Located in "{url}/user/recipe", or by clicking on "My Recipe" on the navbar. There is a form, allows users to post their own recipes.
        - note: since there's only use state in use, the new recipe made by the user will disappear after refreshing.
